## Alice EEG 

Preprocessing and analyses for EEG data collected while participants listened to Chapter 1 of *Alice in Wonderland*

### Getting started

Raw data files are available at <https://doi.org/10.7302/Z29C6VNH>

1. Download the data (`S01.eeg` `S01.vhdr` `S01.vmrk` etc.) and place into a local directory
2. Download prePROCessing parameters (`proc.zip`) and unzip into a local directory
3. install fieldtrip for MATLAB (<https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org>)

### Data Collection

EEG data were collected from March 2015 to December 2016 at the University of Michigan [Computational Neurolinguistics lab](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/cnllab). Signals were recorded from 61 actively amplified electrodes in a equidistant layout (easycap M10), filtered  between 0.01 and 200 Hz and digitized at 500 Hz with a actiCHamp amplifier. A bipolar vertical EOG over the left eye (`VEOG`) was also collected along with a digitized copy of the acoustic input (`AUD`). 

Adult participants listened to a 12 m audiobook recording of *Alice in Wonderland*, chapter 1 over insert earphones (Etymotic EA-2) at a loudness of 45 dB above individually-determined hearing threshold. The audio file was divied into 12 segments and a digital trigger was sent at the onset of each segment. The audio stimulus is available with the raw data as `audio.zip`

### Data Analyses

#### `preprocessing`

Several published analyses use the same preprocessed data files. The pipeline is described in detail at <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207741> (citation above).
