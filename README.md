## Alice EEG 

Preprocessing and analyses for EEG data collected while participants listened to Chapter 1 of *Alice in Wonderland*

### Getting started

Raw data files available at <https://doi.org/10.7302/Z29C6VNH>

Data preprocessing requires MATLAB. 
Group statistical analyses require MATLAB, R, and STAN

1. Download the data (`S01.eeg` `S01.vhdr` `S01.vmrk` etc.) and place into a local directory
2. Download prePROCessing parameters (`proc.zip`) and unzip into a local directory
3. install fieldtrip for MATLAB (<https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org>)

### Data Collection

EEG data were collected from March 2015 to December 2016 at the University of Michigan [Computational Neurolinguistics lab](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/cnllab). Signals were recorded from 61 actively amplified electrodes in a equidistant layout (easycap M10), filtered  between 0.01 and 200 Hz and digitized at 500 Hz with a actiCHamp amplifier. A bipolar vertical EOG over the left eye (`VEOG`) was also collected along with a digitized copy of the acoustic input (`AUD`). 

Adult participants listened to 12 m audiobook recording of *Alice in Wonderland*, chapter 1 over insert earphones (Etymotic EA-2) at a loudness of 45 dB above individually-determined hearing threshold. The audio file was divied into 12 segments and a digital trigger was sent at the onset of each segment. The audio stimulus is available with the raw data as `audio.zip`

### Data Analyses

#### Preprocessing

Several published analyses use the same preprocessed data files. The pipeline is described in detail at <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207741> (citation above). 

Data processing was was originally conducted with MATLAB 2017a and Fieldtrip mid-2017. The analysis was last tested with MATLAB 2022a and [Fieldtrip 3be5222fc](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/3be5222fc8d8ed28df9b1200fe2ebe22733c0c4b) (2023-05-03)

Data processing was was originally conducted with MATLAB 2017a, Fieldtrip mid-2017, R 3.4.4, brms 2.1.0 and rstan 2.21.7. The analysis was last tested with MATLAB 2022am, [Fieldtrip 3be5222fc](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/3be5222fc8d8ed28df9b1200fe2ebe22733c0c4b) (2023-05-03), R 4.2.0, brms 2.17.9, and rstan 2.21.7
