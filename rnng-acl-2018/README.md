To run:

1. Download and prepare the data with the [preprocessing pipeline](../preprocessing/README.md)
2. Run the MATLAB script `run-group-analysis.m`
3. Run the R script `roi-model-comparison.R` 

**Requirements** Data processing was was originally conducted in February 2018. The analysis was last tested with MATLAB 2022a, [Fieldtrip 3be5222fc](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/3be5222fc8d8ed28df9b1200fe2ebe22733c0c4b) (2023-05-03), R 4.2.0, tidyverse 1.1.0, and lme4 1.1-29
